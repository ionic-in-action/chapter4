This repository contains the code from the chapter 4 example of Ionic in Action. It is an app for a resort that guests could use to learn about their reservation, local restaurants, and current weather.

Here are the primary things we do in this chapter.

* Setup navigation with history
* Use the slide box, used as an app intro
* Load data from external APIs using loading indicators
* Setup and use infinite scrolling
* Use Ionic's icon set Ionicons
* Use Ionic cards and lists
